# My solutions for Advent of Code using GOLANG
I recently found and fell in love with Advent of Code and decided to challenge myself to complete all of them starting from the very beginning published in 2015!
This is my way of getting familiar with GOLANG while having fun doing so.
I am not an expert, my code might be a mess at times and take longer to compute than those that are more effeciently written but my uploaded solution should work for anyone as they are only commited once the puzzle has been solved.

## What is Advent of Code
Advent of Code is a yearly Christmas themed coding puzzle written by Eric Wastl over at https://adventofcode.com/
